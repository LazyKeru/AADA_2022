# Q2

> Question 2 : Modify the code to produce a logistic regression model on the data on the full dimension of the problem.

Now the logistic regression model will use the 3 other features: 'sepal width', 'sepal length' and 'petal  length'. We only have to switch a few arguments.

## X

X is a tensor structure which only contains all features of the flowers('sepal width', 'sepal length', 'petal  length', 'petal  width'). And it also has a column of '1'.
The X are our set of available data to predict the class of a flower.

```
[[1. 4.9 3.  1.4 0.2]
 [1. 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2]
 ...
 [1. 6.2 3.4 5.4 2.3]
 [1. 5.9 3.  5.1 1.8]]
```

## Y

Y is a tensor structure which represents the two possible class that a flower can be (labels). It is used to calculate the error by substracting the predicted label with the real label :
- 1 if the flower is of type 2
- 0 if the flower is another type

```
[0 0 0 ... 1 1 1 1]
```
