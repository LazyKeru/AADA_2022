# Q1

> Q1 : Analyze this example precisely in order to fully understand how it works. Attach particular importance to the structuring of data tables used for learning.

There are two dataset used for the machine learning algorithm.

## X

X is a tensor structure which only contains the "petal  width" features of the flowers. And it also has a column of '1'.
The X are our set of available data to predict the class of a flower.

```
[[1. 0.2]
 [1. 0.2]
 ...
 [1. 2.3]
 [1. 1.8]]
```

## Y

Y is a tensor structure which represents the two possible class that a flower can be (labels). It is used to calculate the error by substracting the predicted label with the real label :
- 1 if the flower is of type 2
- 0 if the flower is another type

```
[0 0 0 ... 1 1 1 1]
```
