# CNN

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep neural network primarily used in image classification and computer vision applications. This article will guide you through creating your own image classification model by implementing CNN using the TensorFlow package in Python.

Convolutional networks were inspired by biological processes in that the connectivity pattern between neurons resembles the organization of the animal visual cortex.

# Obtained result

train accuracy : 0.97
test accuracy : 0.96

We obtained better result with the CNN of our teacher than the MLP
